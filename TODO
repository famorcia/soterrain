General:
 - make terrain algorithm nodes superclass
 - make tile based algorithm nodes superclass
 - tranlsate comments
 - preppend "this->" to all methods and attributes
 - make internal functions private instead of protected
 - start using code tags
 - let headers include only header for definition not for implementation too
 - change code comments to inline comments.

Geo MipMapping:
 - check if tile tree size is computed corectly
 - better height map size checking
 - change tile vertices array to SbList
 - change tile array to SbList
 - make better static error computation
 - remove tile center from tile structure
 - implement algorithm freezing by storing view volume and viewport region.

ROAM:
 - height map size checking
